6) We undertake our business through: 
    (i) direct ownership of hotel properties; 
    (ii) long-term leases for existing hotels which are owned by third parties; and 
    (iii) operating and management agreements. 
   As of May 25, 2018, we have a portfolio of 22 owned hotels, 6 leased hotels and 22 managed hotels.
7) In the fiscal year 2018, our owned and leased hotels had an average occupancy rate of 75.9%. In the fiscal year 2017, our owned and leased hotels had an average occupancy rate of 76.8%, while the average occupancy rate across all
participating hotels in India was 61.8% for the same period, according to the FHRAI-Indian Hotel Industry Survey, 2016-17.Further, 26 out of our 41 hotels (which were operational for at least a year and were eligible for receiving this recognition) were awarded the TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence for 2018
8) We have been ranked among the “Best Companies to Work for” in India for seven consecutive years from 2011 to 2017, by the Great Place to Work Institute, including in 2017 when we were ranked the 4 th “Best Company to Work for” in India and were the only hotel company in the top 10. We were ranked 12 th in Asia’s best large workplaces in 2018 by the Great Place to Work Institute and we are the only Indian Company in the top 15.
9) We plan to expand in an asset-light way by focusing on growth through acquisition of leased hotels and management contracts. We will also continue to evaluate new sites for greenfield development as well as prospective hotel assets for acquisition. Our expansion strategy is to continue to grow in both tier I and tier II cities important for commerce as well as tier III cities, which attract significant business or leisure travellers. We also intend to add more leisure and resort properties to our portfolio
10) Lower than industry cost of development per room. 
        Upper   :   5.9 Million Rs (Industry avg 7.2 Million Rs)
        mid     :   5.0 Million Rs (Industry avg 5.6 Million Rs)
        eco     :   4.5 Million Rs (Industry avg 3.6 Million Rs)
        Source: HVS- India – 2016 Hotel Development Cost Survey
11) 82% of our guests were domestic customers in fiscal year 18. Key driver: low staff to room ratio. Lower by 30%, 20% and 40% over industry in the upper-midscale, midscale and economy segments respectively, in fiscal year 2017
12) Lemon Tree Hotels adopts a stray dog at each of its hotels across India. We name the dog, inoculate it and feed it well. Based on the personality of the dog, he/she is assigned a ‘fun’ role in the hotel and this brings joy to employees and guests alike.
13) Demand for hotel rooms grew at a CAGR of 12.5% between the fiscal years 2007 and 2016. Supply grew at a CAGR of 13.7% during this same period. This imbalance of supply exceeding demand starting from the global financial crisis and materially caused by a slowdown in the Indian economy, has resulted in a moderate performance in the hotel
Industry over the past decade. This lack of demand and business confidence combined to create an environment where hotels across India were reluctant to increase room rates to levels that are reasonable and which would be commensurate with an adequate return on capital employed. This trend has, however begun to change over the past 12 months where the pace of demand has started to rise while supply growth has materially slowed down.
14) Furthermore, our sales, marketing, revenue management and customer relationship teams work together to increase hotel occupancies leveraging our loyalty program, Lemon Tree Smiles, which has an active and loyal members database of over 7.5 lakh guests, as of May 2018. This loyalty program was launched by us less than 3 years ago and has gained significant traction since then.
15) CAGR of operating cost increase per room has been only 4% between fiscal years 2013 and 2018. Our business
model ensures that our staff per room is also much lower when compared to industry averages 
16) EcoSoc includes people from communities who do not get employment opportunities easily on account of a lack of education; widowed, separated and abandoned women; orphans and individuals below the poverty line. This initiative
was started in 2007 and such individuals number about 1,000 currently, which is 18% of our workforce. We intend to take this to 40% of our significantly larger workforce by fiscal year 2022.
17) The hotel industry is at an inflection point today with improving fundamentals on the back of growth in
domestic travel, which is expected to continue to rise with increasing urbanisation, higher disposable incomes and changing aspirations of the consuming Indian middle class.
18) As part of this strategy in 2012, Lemon Tree formed a joint venture with APG (a Dutch pension fund) by contributing certain completed and operational properties. This was matched by a large capital infusion by APG, which was then used by us to develop new hotels. This structure has enabled us to leverage our development and
operating expertise and earn development and management fees from these hotels. This model is capital efficient and will also help in monetizing our fully/partially owned hotels in the future. (More Research on this is needed!!)

19) The middle class population in India has doubled from 300 mn to 600 mn between 2004 and 2012 and is likely to overtake that of US and China by 2027.

20) The Indian hotel market is comparatively under- penetrated. The following table outlines the penetration of hotel supply in the United States, China, India and the world 
    Penetration (Rooms/ 1,000 people)
    World   :   2.2
    USA     :   15.7
    China   :   2.7
    India   :   0.2 (11X growth potential compared to world!!)
21) The hotel sector in India experienced a decrease in occupancy between the fiscal years 2008 and 2009 and again between the fiscal years 2011 and 2013. This was primarily due to the difference between supply and demand in these periods which was caused by substantial growth in supply and a parallel decline in demand. The slackening of occupancy invariably leads to a rate decline thereby negatively impacting RevPAR levels. Further, rate revival lags occupancy revival
22) The upward trend in RevPAR has been led by occupancy and is expected to continue.
Further, ADR is now expected to improve due to higher occupancy levels.
